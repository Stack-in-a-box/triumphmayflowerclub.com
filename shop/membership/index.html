            <h1>Club Membership</h1>
            <p>Club membership is £35pa with a £6 joining fee. To apply for or renew membership: download, print and fill-in the appropriate membership form below along with a cheque, postal order, money order (or set-up a standing order) to the membership secretary, John (contact details in the sidebar). You can also pay by Pay Pal – just contact John Corley for details.</p>
            <p>In the future, we hope to make it possible to apply and pay for club membership entirely through the club website. In the meantime, we have now made the PDF directly editable, so you can fill most of the fields out by downloading it, editing it in your browser and then printing it for signing (thanks to Trevor Adams for the suggestion).</p>
