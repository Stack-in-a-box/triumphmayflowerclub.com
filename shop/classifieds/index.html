                                <p>It is with great regret that I have had to sell my Mayflower. We are moving to Torquay and parking is restricted to one resident permit parking space per household.</p>
                                <p>I turned down the first two viewers as they didn’t seem to be “right”. The third viewer was very enthusiastic and seemed to be extremely experienced when talking about restoration and historic cars. I’ve told him about the Triumph Mayflower Club and furnished him a copy of the magazine.</p>
                                <p>It is a shame I had to let the car go but if I can find cheap storage when we move to Torquay, I may invest in another but I think it would struggle with! On the plus side, we’ll be mortgage free when we move.</p>

                            <h5>Ideal for a “Mayflower lover”</h5>
                            <p>A former member, Derek Norris, has asked us to circulate details of his Triumph Mayflower which he is hoping to sell. Derek prefers the car to be sold to a Mayflower lover and is therefore offering it to club members first. The car has been garaged for 20 years and there are many spare parts with it.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The vehicle is the earliest one known to the club (TT 355 DL) and was first registered 12/10/1950.</li>
                                <li>It is burgundy.</li>
                                <li>The vehicle comes with its original registration – <span class="numberPlateMarker">WMD 111</span> – which the owner wishes to remain with the car. The vehicle is registered with the DVLA.</li>
                                <li>The vehicle is in Farnham, Surrey.</li>
                                <li>The car will need some attention.</li>
                                <li>There are lots of bits and pieces to go with it as well.</li>
                                <li>The price would be £4,000 to any TMC member.</li>
                                <li>Owner has been offered £3,750 for the plate alone, but they would still much prefer the plate to stay with the car.</li>

                                <p>After putting my MayFlower up for sale approximately two years ago and having a few people who were not really interested in look at it, I have been slowly tinkering with it but am finding that due to health reasons I am having to look at selling her again.</p>
                                <p>In the past two years with the help of various mechanics I have rebuilt the engine and gear box assembly. The engine was then re-fitted by a garage that services all my families cars including the MayFlower.</p>
                                <p>The car is running nicely after 165 miles but as I said the time has come to sell her and all her spares.</p>
                                <p>I would put her down as in a B+ state with no rust anywhere. The price with all the spares is £2,500 or any sensible nearest offer.</p>
                                <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

                            <h4>Triumph Mayflower instruction book for sale</h4>
                            <p>I have had a series of conversations with Thierry in France (in both English and French!) about an instruction book for the Mayflower which is currently on French eBay. It has an interesting ‘ERRATA’ pasted inside the cover for the French market, explaining that the bolts aren’t metric!</p>
                            <p>If you’re a collector – this might be for you.</p>
                            <p>The link to the eBay listing is below. Thanks, Thierry, for contacting me.</p>
                            <p>P.s. Could anyone with comments about the ‘Errata’ please let me know.</p>

                            <h4>A half-tidy Mayflower</h4>
                            <h5>With good paint and no rust or hidden problems</h5>
                            <p>Notes from the seller:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>I can do most things mechanical and am very happy also to sort out ‘tired’ trim but I am no good at welding or spraying and would not want the hassle of getting such work done by others.</p>
                                <p>I am seriously interested in the right car at a realistic price (a 52 Mayflower was my first car). Distance is not an issue and I can get the right car trailered home if necessary. Anyone with something to offer, please contact me by email.</p>
