            <h1>Members’ Classifieds</h1>
            <p>If you would like to place an advert on this page, please get in-touch with our website editor, Rob (contact details in the sidebar), and he’ll get it published.</p>
            <p>The advert will remain on the website for three months after the date of publication and will then be removed. If you have success in selling or acquiring your items in the meantime, please let us know so that we can keep the section relevant and up-to-date.</p>
            <p>If after three months you wish for your advert to be re-submitted, please contact Rob again; if this is the case, perhaps you could think about altering the asking price, and possibly submit further photos to enhance the listing and boost your chances of attracting a buyer.</p>
            <p>If you are <strong>not</strong> yet a member, feel free to use this facility to advertise all things Mayflower, but a donation of £10 to the club would be appreciated (cheques made payable to TMC, and sent to the editor; address available on request). This will help in our quest to keep these magnificent cars on the road.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

                        <h4>Mayflower project for sale</h4>
                        <p>From the seller:</p>
                        <blockquote>“Triumph Mayflower/Herald project for sale. Due to ill health I’m having to sell my Mayflower project. It’s an early, small rear window model from 1950. The car is complete BUT the engine has been removed having seized. I intended to replace it with a good 1200 herald engine. This has been done by a couple of club members and it is a very satisfactory conversion. The car will need new sills and wing bottoms fitting, which are supplied. It has a very good underside – no holes. It will need some restoring and bits re-fitting and head lining etc. It seems to have had recent brake work as there are many new bits. I would like around £650 for the car and £250 for the herald engine. Please see attached photo.”</blockquote>
