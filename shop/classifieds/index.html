            <h1>Members’ Classifieds</h1>
            <p>If you would like to place an advert on this page, please get in-touch with our website editor, Rob (contact details in the sidebar), and he’ll get it published.</p>
            <p>The advert will remain on the website for three months after the date of publication and will then be removed. If you have success in selling or acquiring your items in the meantime, please let us know so that we can keep the section relevant and up-to-date.</p>
            <p>If after three months you wish for your advert to be re-submitted, please contact Rob again; if this is the case, perhaps you could think about altering the asking price, and possibly submit further photos to enhance the listing and boost your chances of attracting a buyer.</p>
            <p>If you are <strong>not</strong> yet a member, feel free to use this facility to advertise all things Mayflower, but a donation of £10 to the club would be appreciated (cheques made payable to TMC, and sent to the editor; address available on request). This will help in our quest to keep these magnificent cars on the road.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

It has a set of reasonable tyres and comes with a workshop manual, owner’s manual, and many related documents.

                        <p>The car seems largely rust free, apart from superficial rust and damaged paintwork, despite being stored for 4 decades.</p>
                        <p>The engine was filled with oil down the plug holes prior to storage so this may have kept the engine from going solid.</p>
                        <p>It clearly needs quite a lot of work, but seems basically sound.</p>
                        <p>Rob wants £1,500 based on being quite solid and even in spares it seems good value (I hope it won’t be broken up — ED).</p>
                        <p>The registration number is: A999BKY, so has obviously been swapped at some stage.</p>

Be sure to check this section first, in case one of your fellow members is looking to offload one (of course the spares department always has an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/shop/spares">extensive selection</a> if you can’t find what you’re after here)! If you wish to have a ‘clear out’, gain a little cash and give others the opportunity to obtain the parts they need to keep their Mayflower on the road, then why not contact Rob to have your advert included?</p>
