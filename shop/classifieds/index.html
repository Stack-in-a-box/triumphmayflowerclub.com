            <h1>Members’ Classifieds</h1>
            <p>If you would like to place an advert on this page, please get in-touch with our website editor, Rob (contact details in the sidebar), and he’ll get it published.</p>
            <p>The advert will remain on the website for three months after the date of publication and will then be removed. If you have success in selling or acquiring your items in the meantime, please let us know so that we can keep the section relevant and up-to-date.</p>
            <p>If after three months you wish for your advert to be re-submitted, please contact Rob again; if this is the case, perhaps you could think about altering the asking price, and possibly submit further photos to enhance the listing and boost your chances of attracting a buyer.</p>
            <p>If you are <strong>not</strong> yet a member, feel free to use this facility to advertise all things Mayflower, but a donation of £10 to the club would be appreciated (cheques made payable to TMC, and sent to the editor; address available on request). This will help in our quest to keep these magnificent cars on the road.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

                            <p>“With a heavy heart, I am going to have to sell my ’flower, MSK 250.</p>
                            <p>The grill has been re-chromed, and new upper ball joints and track rods have been fitted. She needs a bit of TLC but would not take much to get her back up and pootling along, she will need to be trailered as she will need the fuel draining – she has been standing for a year.</p>
                            <p>Manuals and loads of spares included: another engine (maybe locked up can’t remember), windshield, side glass rubbers, gaskets, fan belt and much more. Also included are the hand crank, jack, metal fuel can. I will let the old tools and spanners, etc., plus other bits and bobs such as the bottles of lead additive, go as well.”</p>

                        <h4>Triumph Mayflower 1953 (£2,000 ono)</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“I am reluctantly selling my late father’s Triumph Mayflower. This was a project that he didn’t manage to get around to before he passed away. I have attempted to kick-start a restoration on it but the costs of me sub-contracting this out would sadly far outweigh the value of the car. This would fall into the ‘project’ category, engine is seized, and car does require a lot of welding. A great project for someone with the time and mechanical skills to take this on.It has 4 new tyres (ignore tyres in the photo), and been in for some welding on the sills and 4 pillars costing me the equivalent of the offer price.</p>
                            <p>I have purchased some parts from an ex-owner containing things like crankshaft, inlet exhaust manifold, clutch, water pump, oil pump, starter motor, dynamo, hub caps (× 4),  starting handle, workshop manual (see photo). Also bought some parts switches and window seals from the Mayflower owners’ stock.</p>
                            <p>If you would like to discuss further, please contact me.</p>
                            <p>
                                Thanks,<br>

                    <p>Missing something for your build? A part just bitten the dust on you? Be sure to check this section first, in case one of your fellow members is looking to offload one (of course the spares department always has an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/shop/spares">extensive selection</a> if you can’t find what you’re after here)! If you wish to have a ‘clear out’, gain a little cash and give others the opportunity to obtain the parts they need to keep their Mayflower on the road, then why not contact Rob to have your advert included?</p>
