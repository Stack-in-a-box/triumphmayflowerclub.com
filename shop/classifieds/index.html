            <h1>Members’ Classifieds</h1>
            <p>If you would like to place an advert on this page, please get in-touch with our website editor, Rob (contact details in the sidebar), and he’ll get it published.</p>
            <p>The advert will remain on the website for three months after the date of publication and will then be removed. If you have success in selling or acquiring your items in the meantime, please let us know so that we can keep the section relevant and up-to-date.</p>
            <p>If after three months you wish for your advert to be re-submitted, please contact Rob again; if this is the case, perhaps you could think about altering the asking price, and possibly submit further photos to enhance the listing and boost your chances of attracting a buyer.</p>
            <p>If you are <strong>not</strong> yet a member, feel free to use this facility to advertise all things Mayflower, but a donation of £10 to the club would be appreciated (cheques made payable to TMC, and sent to the editor; address available on request). This will help in our quest to keep these magnificent cars on the road.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

                            <p>Reluctant sale (after 50 years of ownership), because of an unexpected house move.</p>
                            <p>Black with maroon Vynide upholstery. Fitted in the 1980s: a Triumph 1296cc OHV engine to enable it to keep up with modern traffic; a brake servo to help it stop; a stainless steel exhaust system, and flashing as well as semaphore indicators. It served for many years as my daily transport. Last year I spent over £4,300 on having the engine overhauled; a new wiring loom fitted; all the brake cylinders and hoses replaced; structural welding done to both sills; new tyres and battery fitted, and leaky oil seals replaced. Also for sale: many of the parts (some very rare) needed to complete the restoration.</p>
                            <p>To get the car to concours-condition, the following would be required: repair of minor blemishes to the bodywork; beautifying the engine compartment; replacing some of the sealing rubbers; re-chroming the rear bumper; replacing the headlining and carpets, and replacing the springs in the base of the driver’s seat.</p>
                            <p><strong>Sensible offers invited!</strong></p>
                            <p>For more information, or to view the car (near Bristol), please contact Peter Burdge.</p>

                    <p>Missing something for your build? A part just bitten the dust on you? Be sure to check this section first, in case one of your fellow members is looking to offload one (of course the spares department always has an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/shop/spares">extensive selection</a> if you can’t find what you’re after here)! If you wish to have a ‘clear out’, gain a little cash and give others the opportunity to obtain the parts they need to keep their Mayflower on the road, then why not contact Rob to have your advert included?</p>
