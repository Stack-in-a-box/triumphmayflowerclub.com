            <h1>Members’ Classifieds</h1>
            <p>If you would like to place an advert on this page, please get in-touch with our website editor, Rob (contact details in the sidebar), and he’ll get it published.</p>
            <p>The advert will remain on the website for three months after the date of publication and will then be removed. If you have success in selling or acquiring your items in the meantime, please let us know so that we can keep the section relevant and up-to-date.</p>
            <p>If after three months you wish for your advert to be re-submitted, please contact Rob again; if this is the case, perhaps you could think about altering the asking price, and possibly submit further photos to enhance the listing and boost your chances of attracting a buyer.</p>
            <p>If you are <strong>not</strong> yet a member, feel free to use this facility to advertise all things Mayflower, but a donation of £10 to the club would be appreciated (cheques made payable to TMC, and sent to the editor; address available on request). This will help in our quest to keep these magnificent cars on the road.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>

                        <p>This car is available in the Netherlands. It has been stored for 20 years but the owner didn’t have time to restore it. By the look of the number plate, it is British-registered, and presumably right-hand drive, but be sure to check this for yourselves.</p>
                        <p>No price as yet, but a photo was included, and more photos are available if wanted.</p>

                    <p>Missing something for your build? A part just bitten the dust on you? Be sure to check this section first, in case one of your fellow members is looking to offload one (of course the spares department always has an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/shop/spares">extensive selection</a> if you can’t find what you’re after here)! If you wish to have a ‘clear out’, gain a little cash and give others the opportunity to obtain the parts they need to keep their Mayflower on the road, then why not contact Rob to have your advert included?</p>

                        <p>Colin, a relatively new club member, is looking for a Mayflower after 60 years of admiring them. He is looking for one in “reasonable condition and up-and-running, a rolling restoration, or with room for improvement, so-to-speak”.</p>
                        <p>He is prepared to re-commission a vehicle from long term storage, as long as it is complete and sound. He says that he doesn’t have time for a full restoration but would consider something that needs a <i>‘little fettling’</i>.</p>
