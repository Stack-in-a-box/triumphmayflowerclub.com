            <h1>Spares</h1>
            <p>We have an extensive stock of spare parts managed by our spares secretary, Paul (contact details in sidebar). Make sure you check with Paul first that the items you want are still in stock before sending payment! When enquiring about parts, please quote the TMC reference number and/or the Stanpart number (both are listed in the catalogue below) of the part(s) you are enquiring about as well as your telephone number. Postage rates vary from £2-10. Some items are collection-only due to their size or you can arrange for a courier to collect them on your behalf. In addition, we now also provide a catalogue of old used keys for sale.</p>

                    <p>“SPARES UPDATE</p>
                    <p>The Triumph Sports Six Club, where we keep our spares, is now open to the public again. As it is a 30-mile round trip for me to collect spares for despatch I try and limit visits to once a week if orders warrant it. They are having an open day on 5<sup>th</sup> December.</p>
                    <p>I am currently trawling the major Triumph parts suppliers for Mayflower spares and equivalents and trying to ensure we have at least one of each item available in stock in case they become unavailable in the future. Details of equivalents, sizes, etc., are being added to the spares catalogue.</p>
                    <p>CHOKE & STARTER CABLES</p>
                    <p>These are now in stock @ £27.50 each. They have a threaded end rather than the Lucas fitting and come with a threaded Mayflower knob.</p>
                    <p>ACCELERATOR CABLE</p>
                    <p>Remade by the same company as the choke & starter cables, these are now in stock @ £20 each. </p>
                    <p>THROTTLE SPRING</p>
                    <p>I have had some of the long compression throttle springs (59127) made. These are now in stock @ £4 each.</p>
                    <p>MAYFLOWER SCRIPT DOOR BADGES</p>
                    <p>These were ordered in May and have still not made it to the production line. Fortunately, the company did not ask for payment up front.</p>
                    <p>FRONT COIL SPRINGS</p>
                    <p>Front coil springs (101181) have been made and are now in stock @ £60 each.</p>
                    <p>QUARTERLIGHT CATCH COIL SPRING WASHER</p>
                    <p>I have had some vent catch coil spring washers (600316) remade and these are in stock @ £0.75 each.</p>
                    <p>PEDAL GROMMET</p>
                    <p>This project is now with the firm that made the cables for me.</p>
                    <p>HEATER LEVER CONTROL KNOBS</p>
                    <p>These are being remanufactured and will be available very shortly @ £3 each.</p>
                    <p>SHOCK ABSORBERS</p>
                    <p>I am now stocking both front and rear shocks. The front shocks are modern TR equivalents @ £17.50 each. The rear shocks are Monroe R2642 which require their bushes pressing out and replacing with the club supplied Mayflower ones. These are £37.50 each inc. the bushes. I can also supply a KYB version for around £30 each.</p>
                    <p>GEARBOXES</p>
                    <p>Reminder: gearboxes for free, collection only. I need the room!</p>
