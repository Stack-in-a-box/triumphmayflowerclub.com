            <h1>Events</h1>
            <p>In some ways this is the most important section of the website; with information about where events are to take place where members can show off their pride and joy, gain inspiration during the dark days mid-way through a re-build or to pick-up those hard-to-find widgets.</p>
            <p>I envisage that this section will grow as members from around the world start to contribute stories about their visits to local, or not so local, events. Also, it should be a good place to reminisce about events, cars and, most importantly, people we have met on our voyage through the journey which is the ownership of the Triumph Mayflower.</p>
            <p>Happy Mayflowering!</p>

            <h2>Mayflowers in-bloom</h2>
            <p>This section is completely reliant upon members sending their stories of their days out and photos of what they have seen. Please let us have accounts of events you have visited so that other members might decide to support them in the future. This applies to the local town or charity event to national events at large showgrounds. Also, we are keen to have more reports from outside the UK, perhaps this website will allow members or others interested in the Mayflower to contact us more readily.</p>
            <p>If you know of upcoming events in your area, let us know and we can include them on the events calendar for your area.</p>
