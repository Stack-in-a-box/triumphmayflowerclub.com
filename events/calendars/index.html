            <p>Listed below are any events, both national and local, that we have been notified about. They appear in the order they were received, as some entries may have multiple events listed whereas some may be of a single event only.</p>
            <p>All listings will remain in perpetuity so that members are able to enquire with organisers if an event listed in a previous year will go ahead again. These listings will be under annual headings similar to those for “TMC Club Rallies” and “Local Events”.</p>
            <p>Happy Mayflowering!</p>

            <h2>Other regions and countries</h2>
            <p>This section is for members to plan what events they may wish to attend, either nationally or smaller local events.</p>
            <p>It will, by the nature of the club membership be skewed towards UK events, but need not be. If any of our overseas members have forthcoming events to let members be aware of, please let me know.</p>
            <p>And if you do attend any of these events (or others not listed) send a report or just photos to me for inclusion on the “Local Events” page.</p>
