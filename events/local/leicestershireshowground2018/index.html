            <p>This was the first of a new auto jumble and classic car meet on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Sunday of each month. The forecast was a bit iffy but I was itching to show off the new paint job and try out the new rear springs. It was quite novel being able to see out of the rear window through the interior mirror. Lots of compliments on the paint job and the possibility of more work for my over worked body man.</p>
            <p>Due to water logging the meet was moved to the car park of the Harborough Innovation Centre. I think the weather had put the auto jumblers off as there were only 3 stallholders in attendance, but classic owners must be made of sturdier stuff as there were about 60 cars as well as motorbikes in evidence through the session. Even the fire brigade turned up to let the kiddies (and some of their elders) climb all over their engine.</p>
