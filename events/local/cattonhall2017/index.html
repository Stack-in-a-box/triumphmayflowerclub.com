            <h2>30<sup>th</sup> April 2017</h2>
            <h3>Report by Rob Davies</h3>
            <img class="fullWidthArticleImage" src="image1.jpg">
            <p>The 18<sup>th</sup> ‘Catton Hall Classic Car and Transport Show’ took place at Catton Hall, Alrewas (near Lichfield, Staffordshire) on Sunday 30<sup>th</sup> April 2017. The setting was very attractive, being located alongside the River Trent.</p>
            <img class="rightArticleImage" src="image2.jpg" width="310px">
            <p>The show was described by the advertisers as a ‘super one-day event’, catering for classic enthusiasts and all the family. It certainly lived-up to its own ‘hype’, with over 700 classic motors in attendance (both pre- and post-war). There were military vehicles (including some American examples), plus classic motorcycles and even some modified motors (which seem to have a habit of turning-up at these gatherings). Of course, there was also a good selection of trade and autojumble stands.</p>

            <p>Paul Burgess attended with his excellent ‘NKA 947’ and managed to win third in class. Well done Paul, plus, of course, your car!</p>
