            <h2>Market Harborough, Leicestershire, 16<sup>th</sup> June 2019</h2>
            <p>Despite a forecast for rain around midday I set off at about 9:15 AM to meet Phil Aychurch at the Market Harborough meet. I didn’t even get to the top of the road before it started to rain, which it did in varying degrees for the whole of the 15-mile trip. On arrival, I joined the other few hardy souls in the café for a coffee. Numbers were definitely down what with the weather and it being Father’s Day. Phil made it about 10:15 in his newly Herald-engined Mayflower on its first successful voyage. The sun eventually came out at about the time the forecast was for rain!</p>
