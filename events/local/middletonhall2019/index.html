            <p>It was with some trepidation that I set out for the 65 mile round trip to the first Middleton Hall meet of the season which is near Tamworth in the Midlands. I had hopefully just solved a problem with missing at high revs by replacing the distributor so this was something of a test run up the A5. The journey took about an hour and I arrived at 10:45 for an 11:00 start. It was packed. Apparently, the spaces in front of the hall were full by 9:30 and the marshals were struggling to find places for the cars now arriving – hence the picturesque spot under the trees not quite in the lake! The 65 miles were completed without incident and so I had a successful and pleasant day out.</p>
