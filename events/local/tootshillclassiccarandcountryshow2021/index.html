            <p>The Toots Hill Classic Car and Country Show in Ongar, Essex took place on Saturday 7<sup>th</sup> August. Despite the early rain, it was a good show with plenty of visitors once the sun came out in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>On the Country Show side of things, there was ferret racing, a birds of prey display with birds flying free, and a guy called “Dangerous Steve” doing stunts in the main arena. In the main tent, there was local produce, craft products, and cakes for the judges to give prizes for.</p>
            <p>On the car side, I was flying the flag for Mayflowers and my car ‘Molly’ managed Best in Show runner-up, beaten by a Formula 1 kit car look alike! Oh well, maybe next year, but all-in-all a good day out for us and Molly.</p>
