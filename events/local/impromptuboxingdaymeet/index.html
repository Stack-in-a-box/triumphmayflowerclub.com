            <p>Half way through my family Christmas dinner, I got a call saying that, as the weather was forecast to be fine, a group of die-hards had decided to have an impromptu meet on Boxing Day. So, deciding I could fit a lunchtime meet in before the next family engagement, I set off the next morning for the 15-mile journey to The Barn Restaurant at Willey, Leics. I arrived at about 11:30 in pleasant weather and over the next 2 hours or so about a dozen classics appeared. We all had a good natter and then departed to go back to our respective Christmases. A very pleasant interlude in the seasonal festivities.</p>
            <p><b>Postscript:</b> This turned out to be the last time I took my car out before I took it in for its body job <i>[I could do with one of those – Rob]</i>. I got it back today after 11 weeks (don’t ask) just in time for a forecast week of rain!</p>
