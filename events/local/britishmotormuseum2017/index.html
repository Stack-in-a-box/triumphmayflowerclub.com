                <h3>Report by John Banks</h3>
                <img class="fullWidthArticleImage" src="image1.jpg">
                <p>With the sun glinting through the curtains, it was time to get organised for another vintage car journey. Camera and sunglasses to hand, wearing full Mayflower regalia, I was now ready to depart.</p>
                <img class="rightArticleImage" src="image2.jpg" width="350px">
                <p>After coaxing Little Nell into life, we set off to our rendezvous point to meet-up with a convoy of Mayflowers to the British Motor Museum at Gaydon.</p>
                <p>As we travelled through the countryside, a timely arrival was achieved and the organisers instructed us to park-up together.</p>
                <p>On the horizon, a recognisable Razoredge look could be seen; another Mayflower was on its way. After all manoeuvres were complete, the wonderful line-up of vehicles glimmered in the sunshine.</p>
                <p>All three different coloured Mayflowers looked superb and gathered interest from show visitors. The Honda Insight hybrid cars were next to the Mayflowers creating a fascinating modern and classic scene.</p>
                <img class="leftArticleImage" src="image3.jpg" width="250px">
                <p>After enjoying all the various makes and models, as well as a collection of army vehicles, a visit inside the museum was needed.</p>
                <p>A mesmerising myriad of cars could be seen with racing and movie cars on display, a truly priceless collection. A pleasant surprise for the eagle-eyed visitor, amongst all the exhibits, was another Mayflower on view, making a total of four to be spotted.</p>
                <p>After enjoying all the facilities and refreshments, it was time to journey home and safely put Little Nell away, ready for another classic adventure in the future.</p>
