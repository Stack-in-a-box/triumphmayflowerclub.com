            <p>Whoever usually does the rain dance prior to the Hinckley meets must have been off ill or on holiday today! What a lovely evening, which was reflected in the numbers attending.</p>
            <p>John Castle and Chad Brown had met up at John’s at 5:30 PM, Chad bringing his Mayflower out of retirement from Birmingham. Even arriving this early they were still positioned half way up Castle Street Hill.</p>

            <p>They managed to save me a space so that we could park up the three Mayflowers together when I arrived at 6:30 PM. John did a good impersonation of a marshal in his high viz jacket. I must get the clutch sorted; it was no fun following the marshal uphill at walking pace with clutch judder.</p>
