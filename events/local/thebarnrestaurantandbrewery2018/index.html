            <p>It makes a nice change to have a civilised start time (11:30 AM) for a Sunday meet. It is only 15 miles or so to Willey so I didn’t have to leave until 11 AM fortified by a nice tomato, sausage and egg fry-up.</p>
            <p>The weather forecast was predicting thunderstorms, and there was a yellow warning out for rain, but it looked ok, so I decided to risk it.</p>
            <img class="rightArticleImage" src="image2.jpg" width="420px">
            <p>There were only 25 or so cars there, probably due to the forecast and it being a bank holiday but there was a good selection of cars attending. Standard Triumph was well represented with my Mayflower, 2 Dolomites, a Vitesse, a Gloria, a Standard 10 and a Standard Flying 10.</p>
            <p>The predicted thunderstorms not having arrived, I left at about 2 PM having had a good natter with various owners to go home to mow the lawn. The thunder started about 5 PM just as I was putting the mower away.</p>
