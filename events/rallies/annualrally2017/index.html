                <p>Hanbury Hall is a large stately home, built in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, standing in parkland at Hanbury, Worcestershire. The main range has two storeys and is built of red brick in the Queen Anne style. It is a Grade I listed building. The associated Orangery and Long Gallery pavilion ranges are listed Grade II.</p>

                <h3>Rally report by John Banks</h3>
                <p>THIS YEAR’S trip led us to Hanbury Hall, so a number of counties were crossed to reach our destination. It was a privilege to travel in the Chairman’s Mayflower, which didn’t miss a beat, allowing us to be the first to arrive at the annual rally.</p>
                <img class="rightArticleImage" src="image2.jpg" width="300px">
                <p>The club gazebo had already been pieced together and safely tied down the previous day, so that all that remained was to attach the sides and reinforce the structure to protect us from the strong winds.</p>
                <p>As the vehicles of the Roadster and Razor Edge Club arrived, a great lineup was created on all areas of grass leading up to Hanbury Hall. A kaleidoscope of colour from all three clubs cars could be seen by visitors to the National Trust attraction.</p>
                <p>In total five Triumph Mayflowers attended: Louis Lemaire (KSF 804); Paul Norton (HTH 719); Dave Gibbs (MSK 250); John Castle (ODV 692); and Chad Brown (617 YUA). Their vehicles all stood proudly with the new feather flag fluttering in the breeze, advertising our presence at the event.</p>
                <p>A number of other Mayflower Club members attended to gain information on restoring their cars, hopefully in the future their completed projects will visit our national rally as well as others held in other parts of the country.</p>
                <img class="leftArticleImage" src="image3.jpg" width="300px">
                <p>One of the Renown owners kindly agreed to judge the Mayflower cars on display, while  raffle tickets were sold to visitors.</p>
                <p>Three awards were presented: Best in Show was won by Paul Norton (HTH 719).</p>
                <p>The distance prize went to Dave Gibbs (MSK 250) who had travelled from Hull, or as he would say “ull.”</p>
                <p>The Chairman’s Cup went to John Banks, which was a very pleasant and unexpected surprise.</p>

                    <p class="imageCaption">John Banks receiving the “Chairman’s Cup”.</p>
                </div>
                <p>After wishing the members of all three clubs a safe journey home, and thanking Tim Newing for his great organisational skills and fore thought for a faultless gathering of cars, it was time to mobilise all the members to assist in dismantling the stand, and do battle with the very windy conditions.</p>
                <p>With another successful rally complete, and after navigating us safely home the Chairman’s Cup is now in pride of place, on my shelf as a wonderful reminder of a truly humbling experience and a superb example of how kind and welcoming the Triumph Mayflower Club is.</p>
