                                <p><b>Date:</b> Sunday 10<sup>th</sup> July.</p>
                                <p><b>Location:</b> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Great+Central+Railway+(Quorn+%26+Woodhouse,+Station)/@52.7403917,-1.1899606,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4879de2ad7971b09:0xc07696503f3c933!8m2!3d52.7404398!4d-1.1877802" target="_blank">Quorn & Woodhouse Station on the Great Central Railway, Loughborough.</a></p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>The 2022 TMC Annual Rally is once again to be held in conjunction with the Triumph Razor Edge Club. It takes place on the 10<sup>th</sup> of July 2022 at Quorn & Woodhouse Station on the iconic Great Central Railway.</p>
                                    <p>Come and enjoy some of our favourite Triumphs as well as allowing yourself to be immersed in the historic Great Central, one of the last main steam-powered railways to be built in Britain.</p>
                                    <p>If you have a working Mayflower, please bring it along, but can you please let John Banks know by <strong>Sunday 26<sup>th</sup> June</strong>, so that he can let the organisers know how many vehicles are expected. Also, if you hope to be there even without a Mayflower, let John know that as well.</p>

                <p>This section will be updated as TMC rallies take place but also will act as an archive for all past rallies as and when rally reports become available and as time allows. Eventually, all official TMC rallies should be recorded here which will provide an invaluable social history of the club.</p>

            <h2>TMC rallies</h2>
            <p>Each spring, we dust our cars down, pull them out of hibernation and then we’re itching to get out and enjoy our wonderful motors. Some of us attend rallies and events around the country, showing-off the magnificent Mayflower to the public.</p>
            <p>Twice a year, as a club, we hold official TMC rallies: our <em>annual rally</em> is usually based in the Midlands and the south of the country whilst the <em>northern rally</em>, as its name suggests, is held in a more convenient location for our northern members.</p>
            <p>Any information that isn’t included on these pages can be obtained from our ‘on-the-day’ rally organiser, John Banks, or our publicity officer, Mark Smith. Thanks, guys, for organising these events!</p>
