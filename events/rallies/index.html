                <p>This section will be updated as TMC rallies take place but also will act as an archive for all past rallies as and when rally reports become available and as time allows. Eventually, all official TMC rallies should be recorded here which will provide an invaluable social history of the club.</p>

            <h2>TMC rallies</h2>
            <p>Each spring, we dust our cars down, pull them out of hibernation and then we’re itching to get out and enjoy our wonderful motors. Some of us attend rallies and events around the country, showing-off the magnificent Mayflower to the public.</p>
            <p>Twice a year, as a club, we hold official TMC rallies: our <em>annual rally</em> is usually based in the Midlands and the south of the country whilst the <em>northern rally</em>, as its name suggests, is held in a more convenient location for our northern members.</p>
            <p>Any information that isn’t included on these pages can be obtained from our ‘on-the-day’ rally organiser, John Banks, or our publicity officer, Mark Smith. Thanks, guys, for organising these events!</p>
