                <p>The cathedral city of Ripon in the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure. It is the third smallest city in England, with fewer than 17,000 inhabitants, even so, not all of them will be at the rally!</p>
                <p>As well as its racecourse and cathedral, Ripon is a tourist destination because of its close proximity to the UNESCO World Heritage Site which consists of the Studley Royal Park and Fountains Abbey.</p>

                <h3>Rally report by John Banks</h3>
                <p>SUNDAY JULY 30th marked the date on the calendar for the Northern Rally. It was Ripon Old Cars Classic Gathering at the race course, with the Mayflowers booked to have their own stand. The weather forecast was not very favourable, a typical British summer’s day!</p>
                <img class="leftArticleImage" src="image2.jpg" width="220px">
                <p>After an early start and with modern power, the Chairman and I arrived in good time but the vintage power of Chad Brown’s Mayflower (617 YUA) beat us, to be the first to arrive! (He had been staying nearby, so didn’t have far to come!)</p>
                <p>The feather flag was constructed to announce our presence and direct the cars to the correct position. The club gazebo was pieced together and luckily in place before the first rain shower of the day.</p>
                <p>Michael Clement from Selby was in attendance but sadly without his Mayflower, due to engine problems, so his lovely Morris Minor 1000 was an honorary Mayflower for the day.</p>
                <p>The next arrival was Dave Gibbs, in his two-tone vehicle that had travelled from Hull, a great sight to behold. The space was starting to fill-up, but still room for more.</p>
                <img class="rightArticleImage" src="image3.jpg" width="300px">
                <p>After sheltering from the elements, the third Mayflower arrived just after the sun was trying to break through the clouds; it was Steve Watts, who had come from Beverley. Once parked up it was time for their picnic brunch and a spot of tea, with a clever use of the circular holes in the boot lid as a tea pot holder.</p>
                <p>The final vehicle to appear from Bradford was Alan Kormes in his newly restored black car. Inside and out, it was a wonderful sight to see.</p>
                <p>All four Mayflowers looked great at Ripon race course, a different kind of “horse power” for visitors to see!</p>
                <p>With bonnets up, inspection and judging of cars took place, and the potential awards to win. We were honoured to have Susan Benfield present the “Peter Benfield Memorial Trophy” for the best in show, which went to Alan Kormes (KOR 985).</p>
                <p>The distance award was won by Dave Gibbs (MSK 250), and Steve Watts (PWJ 737) collected the chairman’s prize. Susan Benfield was also presented with flowers by Chad Brown, rally secretary in front of the best in show car, to thank her for being part of the occasion.</p>
                <p>I am sure Peter Benfield would have been proud and thrilled to look at the Mayflowers on display and pleased that we were all able to carry on this tradition at Ripon in his name.</p>
