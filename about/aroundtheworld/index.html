            <p>This is an extra section for those members who do not live in the UK and may feel that everything Mayflower in Flower Power, or indeed this website, is UK-centric! Not so, all we need is your input; in this area we feature letters and articles published over the years in Flower Power and ask for members to contribute directly to this web site also. In addition, we list current members’ names and contacts (e-mail) categorised by region. If you want to organise a sub-group of regional members – or may already have done so – let us know!</p>

            <p>Where ever you are with your Mayflower we want to hear from you – the club is only as strong as its membership and if we as a club can offer more to our worldwide Triumph Mayflower family then it can only go from strength-to strength. Get in-touch with our website editor, Rob (contact details below), if you would like to contribute to this section.</p>
