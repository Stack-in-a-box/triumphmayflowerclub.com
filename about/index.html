                <p>The Triumph Mayflower Club, formed in 1974, exists to keep these wonderful and unique vehicles on the road and to provide a small part of the motoring heritage for the future. We aim to do this by encouraging ownership, promoting the vehicle to a wider audience and by pooling our enthusiasm, knowledge and known spares supplies. Above all else, we shall do this by helping each other to look after and improve our cars and so preserve them for the future.</p>
                <p>To read about the history of our club, see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/history/club">the club’s page on the history section</a>.</p>

                <h2>The Mayflower</h2>
                <img src="toymayflower.jpg" alt="Toy Mayflower" width="170px">
                <p>The Triumph Mayflower, although very traditional-looking, in the late 1940s / early 1950s had some innovations under the skin for Standard-Triumph – such as unity construction – and also brought a level of comfort not typical of a small car of the time. Although tastes and styles changed rapidly in the ’50s, those who owned or drove a Mayflower seemed to keep an affection for it right to this day.</p>
                <p>It was aimed at the American market, hence its name, reflecting the journey of the pilgrim fathers; but unfortunately for Triumph, the American producers moved ahead very quickly after the war, producing much more modern cars. This forced the hand of Standard-Triumph and the production run of the Mayflower was limited to 35,000 and a very short four years.</p>

                <img src="standardtriumphlogo.jpg" alt="Standard-Triumph Logo" width="200px">
                <p>The history of Standard-Triumph is fascinating, from the beginning of Standard in 1903 to its final demise in 1994! The company was involved in the production of WW2 aeroplanes  as well as the famous ‘Grey Fergie’ tractor. The link between Standard and Triumph, two independent companies, started in 1939 when Standard bought Triumph. Triumph eventually became the dominant name, before being subsumed into British Leyland.</p>

                    <h2>Honours boards</h2>
                </a>
                <p>Over the years, many members have volunteered to help run our club. Clubs need people who are prepared to give their time to make things happen and to ensure that as a membership we have the facilities and information we need to keep our cars going, meet with likeminded people and ensure the continuation of this fabulous car.</p>
                <p>It is only right and proper, therefore, that their efforts are recorded. Not just to say ‘thank you’ but also to record for anyone interested in the history of the club and how it got to where it is today nearly 45 years on.</p>
                <p>In the <a href="honoursboards">honours boards section</a>, all those holders of positions within the club are recorded. Presently this is incomplete, but as time allows and more information becomes available to the editor, these will be completed all the way back to 1974.</p>

                    <h2>Mayflowers around the world</h2>
                </a>
                <p>The Triumph Mayflower, our much-loved car, is to be found in many parts of the world; in-fact members have, over the years, come from all continents, with the exception of Antarctica (where, remarkably, very few cars are to be found)!</p>
                <p>Visit the <a href="aroundtheworld">“Around the world of Mayflowers” section</a> to find articles about the Triumph Mayflower scene in various parts of the world throughout the years. It also provides members who aren’t based in the UK a more specific platform to address members in their own patch as well as the rest of us.</p>

                    <h2>Mayflowers in museums</h2>
                </a>
                <p>This section is very much in its infancy, and I, as the website editor, am asking for the help of all members around the world. If you know of the location of any museum who own and/or exhibit one of our precious cars I would love to hear from you!</p>

            <h2>The about section…</h2>
            <p>This page is quite simply “about the club, car and members”. In-fact, it is quite difficult to separate these: if there were no car (i.e. the Mayflower), then there would be no club, without the club there would be no members. Or put another way: if there were no members interested in the car, there would be no club! Clearly, we are all bound by the desire to see this lovely piece of motoring history continue into the future – that is what this section is <em>about</em>!</p>
            <p>At the time of writing this piece much of the information included is from my own experiences with the club: information gleaned from our magazine and previous website, together with discussions with more seasoned members, and of course the clubs’ historian. However, you as members here in the UK or around the world have your own experiences and we’d love you to share them with us, whether it’s the story of a re-build, an historical anecdote about your first Mayflower or an event you went to, please send them in via the contacts below.</p>
