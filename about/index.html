                <p>The Triumph Mayflower Club, formed in 1974, exists to keep these wonderful and unique vehicles on the road and to provide a small part of the motoring heritage for the future. We aim to do this by encouraging ownership, promoting the vehicle to a wider audience and by pooling our enthusiasm, knowledge and known spares supplies. Above all else, we shall do this by helping each other to look after and improve our cars and so preserve them for the future.</p>

                <h2>The Mayflower</h2>

                <p>The Triumph Mayflower, although very traditional-looking, in the late 1940s / early 1950s had some innovations under the skin for Standard-Triumph – such as unity construction – and also brought a level of comfort not typical of a small car of the time. Although tastes and styles changed rapidly in the ’50s, those who owned or drove a Mayflower seemed to keep an affection for it right to this day.</p>
                <p>It was aimed at the American market, hence its name, reflecting the journey of the pilgrim fathers; but unfortunately for Triumph, the American producers moved ahead very quickly after the war, producing much more modern cars. This forced the hand of Standard-Triumph and the production run of the Mayflower was limited to 35,000 and a very short four years.</p>

                <p>The history of Standard-Triumph is fascinating, from the beginning of Standard in 1903 to its final demise in 1994! The company was involved in the production of WW2 aeroplanes  as well as the famous ‘Grey Fergie’ tractor. The link between Standard and Triumph, two independent companies, started in 1939 when Standard bought Triumph. Triumph eventually became the dominant name, before being subsumed into British Leyland.</p>
