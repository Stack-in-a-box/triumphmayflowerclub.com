                <h2>The club</h2>
                <p>The Triumph Mayflower Club, formed in 1974, exists to keep these wonderful and unique vehicles on the road and to provide a small part of the motoring heritage for the future. We aim to do this by encouraging ownership, promoting the vehicle to a wider audience and by pooling our enthusiasm, knowledge and known spares supplies. Above all else, we shall do this by helping each other to look after and improve our cars and so preserve them for the future.</p>
