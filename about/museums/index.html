            <p>Museums around the world have vehicles amongst their displays; many museums are dedicated to  cars and the history of transport, so it would be unthinkable that our favourite car wouldn’t feature in some way or other! As we manage to locate them, it is our intention to feature them in this section.</p>

            <h2>Help us out</h2>
            <p>As can be seen opposite, this is very much a section in its infancy. At present we have tracked down only two of our cars, with details sketchy. But efforts are underway to expand this search…</p>
            <p><em>You</em> can help! If you are aware of a Mayflower in any other museums, let Rob know and someone will follow it up. It would be lovely to be able to track down all exhibits or references to our car around the world. Who knows it could become a new pilgrimage to see all exhibited Mayflowers – a veritable vehicular ‘i-SPY’ book!</p>
