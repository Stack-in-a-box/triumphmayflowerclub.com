            <p>At long last, we are fully GDPR compliant!! Well, in reality, we were actually all set before the legally-required date, but I’m only now getting round to writing about it, due to shifting priorities… Anyway, the ever-useful Mr Burgess, has written-up our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/miscellaneous#gdprCompliance">GDPR policy</a>, which is available on the documents section of the website. Big thanks to Paul (as always) for getting this sorted in-time for the deadline!</p>
            <p>So, what does this mean for you? Will this affect you? It shouldn’t affect you much at all – all it really means is that your personal data is now even more secure than it was previously. With scammers recently targeting some of the committee members (who voluntarily allow their contact details to be available on the website for our members’ convenience), digital security is more important than ever. If you’d like to read more about it, this Wired article is an excellent resource:</p>

            <p>P.s. For those who are curious, GDPR is an acronym for “<b>G</b>eneral <b>D</b>ata <b>P</b>rotection <b>R</b>egulation”.</p>
