            </h3>
            <p>Sir John Black, who was chairman of Standard Motors at the time they rescued Triumph, must be credited with enabling us to be driving round in our beloved Mayflowers. It’s only right, therefore, that we should mark his birthday, which in on 10<sup>th</sup> February.</p>
            <p>A world-wide event celebrating Sir John’s birthday (which conveniently falls on a Sunday this year), is held annually to celebrate all things Triumph. The event is organised by <b>Rye Livingston</b>, from the ‘Triumph Travellers Sports Car Club’ in Northern California, which is celebrating its 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2019 (contact details <a href="mailto:driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com">driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com</a>).</p>
            <p>Last year, unfortunately only six TMC members submitted photos of their Mayflowers, for publication on the ‘Drive your Triumph Day’ website; I’m ashamed to say that Barbara and I were amongst those who didn’t get round to sending one, but we will make sure we rectify that this year. See the <a href="photos.pdf" target="_blank">attached photos</a> of those who <em>did</em> get round to it last year; it would be great if we could beat that this time.</p>
            <p>As Rye explains:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“The first year the event was organised, [only] about half a dozen members participated <strong>world-wide</strong>, and it’s been building momentum every year since. Last year I received about 250 photos from all over the world – Scotland, Ireland, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Uruguay, Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Holland, Czech Republic and, of course, all over the USA. I’m hoping to double that number this year!</p>
                <p>The concept is straightforward: on February 10<sup>th</sup>, go for a drive in your Triumph. Take a scenic drive on a country road or out to lunch, to the market, to work, wherever. Go for a drive alone or in a big group from your local Triumph Club. Take your spouse, buddy, child, grandchild or your dog; then take a photo. The photo is mainly of the car, and the owner if possible, ideally in front of a cool spot, landmark, scenic view or in your driveway. If it’s the middle of the winter where you live and your car is in hibernation, or in the middle of a restoration, take a photo of it anyway.</p>
                <p>The next step is to e-mail a high-resolution photo to <a href="mailto:driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com">driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com</a>, along with some basic information: owner’s name, year and model of car, and place photo was taken (city, state, country). The photos will then be published not only in our club newsletter, but also in USA’s national magazine, ‘Vintage Triumph Registry’, and on the ‘Drive Your Triumph Day’ website: <a href="https://driveyourtriumphday.shutterfly.com" target="_blank">https://driveyourtriumphday.shutterfly.com</a>.</p>
                <p>This year February 10th falls on a Sunday, so let’s make this a big world-wide event with club drives and lots of photos. Remember, it’s a new photo taken on February 10th, 2019.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Rye continues: <i>“Be sure to contact me with any questions you may have, and thank you in advance for getting the message out to your members and friends to ‘Drive Their Triumphs’ on February 10<sup>th</sup>.”</i></p>
            <p><b>Right, so the challenge is there – let’s have many more than 6 members this year sending your photos to Rye on the 10<sup>th</sup> February, and let’s get 2019 started on a good footing!</b></p>
            <p><b>Please send a copy to me, the Mayflower website editor – Rob.</b></p>
            <p><b>Happy Mayflowering, Rob Davies.</b></p>
            <p>For the record, Rye owns a 1960 Triumph TR3A.</p>
