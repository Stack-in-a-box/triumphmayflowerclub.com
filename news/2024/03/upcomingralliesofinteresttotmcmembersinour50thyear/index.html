            <p>This year, being our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary as a club, we are trying to make our presence felt at a number of rallies around the country, rather than having <em>one annual rally</em>.</p>
            <p>Below are itemised a number of events where a representative (or preferably more than one) of TMC would be desirable. If you go to any of these events, please send some photos, and if possible a few words to Barbara and myself for inclusion in Flower Power / the website.</p>
