            </h3>
            <p>Dear fellow Triumph enthusiast,</p>
            <p>We’re just one month away from the annual Drive Your Triumph Day, Saturday, February 10, 2024.</p>
            <p>In anticipation of Triumphs and Standards hitting the roads worldwide to commemorate Sir John Black’s birthday, I’d like to share some guidelines…</p>
            <p>Participating is easy — on February 10, simply take your Triumph or Standard out for a drive. Capture a photo of the car, and if possible, include the driver/owner in the shot. If you happen to reside in snow-covered regions, or if your car is undergoing restoration, photograph it in its current condition or location (even if it’s tucked away in your garage). Group events and collective photos are great, and individual photos of the cars are also encouraged.</p>
            <p>Following your drive, and before the end of February, kindly send high-resolution versions of your photos to <a href="mailto:driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com?subject=Drive%20Your%20Triumph%20Day">driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com</a>. Ensure that you include your name, the year and model of your car, as well as the city, state, and country where the photo was taken.</p>
            <p>Once all the photos are processed and posted, I’ll send out another email containing the link for you to view the photos.</p>
            <p>Feel free to reach out with any questions you may have, and thank you in advance for getting the message out to your club members and friends to drive their Triumphs and Standards on February 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
            <p>Best Wishes,</p>
            <p>
