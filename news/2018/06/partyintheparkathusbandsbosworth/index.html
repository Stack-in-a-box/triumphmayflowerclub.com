            </h3>
            <p>A quick note from Paul about the ‘Party in the Park’ event in Husbands Bosworth, of which the date has changed from the one listed in the Midlands events calendar:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Hi everyone,</p>
                <p>Driving past Husbands Bosworth this afternoon I spotted an advertising banner for their ‘Party in the Park’ which I was planning to go to tomorrow. The banner said June 30<sup>th</sup> which is a week tomorrow so I don’t know whether the date has been changed or I got it wrong, but anyway don’t go tomorrow.</p>
                <p>Paul”</p>
