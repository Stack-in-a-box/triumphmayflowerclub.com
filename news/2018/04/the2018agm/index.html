            </h3>
            <p>This year, we were fortunate enough to be able to hold our AGM at the headquarters of the Triumph Sports Six Club in Lubenham, Leicestershire. Their fabulous facilities include an interesting museum, which was open prior to the meeting for any early birds to explore. Of course, this is also now the home of the TMC’s spares department; completely overhauled and modernised by the club’s spares secretary, Paul Burgess.</p>
            <p>The meeting was very well attended, which was great to see. There is real forward momentum with the club at the moment; the new website being a very important development (this is something the club has been endeavouring to achieve for some years now). The committee position of <i>publicity officer</i> was created, and this should really help to ‘spread the word’ about the club. Along with the new website, we are hopeful that new members will be enticed to join us!</p>
            <p>Some of the members in attendance have been involved with the club <em>almost</em> since its inception, and their expertise and experience continue to form the bedrock of the TMC. Hopefully, along with newer members, the club will now go from strength to strength for many years to come.</p>
            <p>The minutes from the meeting are now available, as well as updated honours boards and committee contacts:</p>

            <p>Many thanks to all who attended, and to the TSSC for their hospitality.</p>
