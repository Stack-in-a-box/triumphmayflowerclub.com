            </h3>
            <p>Paul Burgess informed me that he noticed in Classic Car Weekly that one of the companies in the suppliers directory, <b>Earlpart</b> (that made exhausts), has gone into liquidation. There was not much information in the CCW article, except that Derby-based Smith Cooper was appointed as liquidator at a meeting on March 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
            <p>Paul added that he wasn’t aware of anyone who had used them, and that he had only found them from a Google search when researching for the suppliers directory. However, they seemed to be the only company supplying Mayflower exhausts from stock.</p>
            <p>He has since informed me that he has found an alternative supplier, <b>PD Gough</b>, who can supply a mild steel system for £290, or a stainless-steel system for £345, both + vat &amp; carriage. See the latest suppliers directory (v8+) for more details.</p>
            <p>Thanks for your efforts Paul.</p>
