            <p>Here it is, at last!</p>
            <p>The new TMC website is launched and from here on it can only get even better as more and more of <em>YOUR</em> articles and technical documents are added.</p>
            <p>The new website has been nine months in the making but I hope you will agree that it has been worth waiting for and that Andy has made a great job of it.</p>
            <p>As eluded to earlier, this is not the end; even though a working website is now available to all members, we have great plans to add more features, such as a search facility, a forum, as well as investigating the possibility of ordering and paying online. If you have any suggestions about improvements, let us know.</p>
            <p>We hope you like the new site…</p>
            <p>Rob and Andy Davies,</p>
            <p>(Web editor and web developer / webmaster respectively)</p>
            <p>P.s. Don’t forget to come to the AGM on 25<sup>th</sup> March (see events pages) to tell us what you think of the website and any other issues!</p>
            <p>P.p.s. Big thanks to Emily Shepherd for helping Andy with getting the website deployment infrastructure in place ready for launch!!</p>
