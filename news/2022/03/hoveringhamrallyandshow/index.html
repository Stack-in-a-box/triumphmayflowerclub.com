            <p>John Oglesby, member 407 and former TMC chairman, has negotiated with the Hoveringham Vintage Vehicle Society for any member of the TMC to attend with their Mayflower. The only stipulation is that they register ASAP, and <em>definitely</em> by the 1<sup>st</sup> of April. See their website for details, and application form: <a href="https://www.hvvs.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.hvvs.co.uk/</a></p>
            <p>The location is Hoveringham, near Lowdham, Notts – easily accessible via the Fosse Way (A46) or the A6097. Those from further north can use the A1 and A614.</p>
            <p>John says it is a good day out, with vintage tractors, lorries, stationary engines, threshing displays, and a dog show (not forgetting the bar for the passengers!). The Notts Air Ambulance usually attends, subject to operational requirements.</p>
            <p>If you’re in that part of the country, give it a go!</p>
