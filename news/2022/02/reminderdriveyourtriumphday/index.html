            <p>Dear fellow Triumph owner,</p>
            <p>Drive Your Triumph Day is coming-up soon on Thursday, February 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
            <p>The concept for DYTD is straightforward: go for a drive in your Triumph on February 10<sup>th</sup>. Take a scenic drive on a country road or out to lunch, to the market, to work, wherever. Go for a drive alone or in a big group from your local Triumph Club. Take your spouse, buddy, child, grandchild or your dog; then take a photo.</p>
            <p>The photo is mainly of the car, and the owner or passenger, if possible, ideally in front of a cool spot, landmark, scenic view or in your driveway. If it’s the middle of the winter where you live and your car is in hibernation, or in the middle of a restoration, take a photo of it in the garage. Have fun with it.</p>
            <p>Next step is to email a high-resolution photo to <a href="mailto:driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com?subject=DYTD%202022">driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com</a>, along with some basic information: owner’s name, year and model of car, and place photo was taken (city, state, country), and if you have an interesting story about the car, include that too.</p>
            <p>The photos will then be published not only in our club newsletter, but also in USA’s national magazine: Vintage Triumph Registry, and on the Drive Your Triumph Day website: <a href="https://driveyourtriumphday.shutterfly.com/" target="_blank">https://driveyourtriumphday.shutterfly.com/</a>. I can also make photos available for other clubs to publish in their newsletter.</p>
            <p>Be sure to contact me with any questions you may have, and remember, send photos there are only taken on February 10<sup>th</sup>, Drive Your Triumph Day.</p>
            <p>Regards,</p>
