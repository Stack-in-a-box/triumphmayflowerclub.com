                <p>INVITATION:</p>
                <p>Dear exhibitor,</p>
                <p>HOVERINGHAM VINTAGE VEHICLE SOCIETY SHOW, SUNDAY 28<sup>th</sup> MAY 2023.</p>
                <p>We will be holding our 23<sup>rd</sup> rally celebrating our 25<sup>th</sup> year on Sunday 28<sup>th</sup> May 2023 at our usual site off Boat Lane, Hoveringham, and we hope you will be able to join us.</p>
                <p>This year’s theme is ‘25 Years of HVVS’. If you have an original exhibit relevant to this, please feel free to bring it along. This year, the main charity that we shall be supporting is the Lincs & Notts Air Ambulance. This charity has been in service for 28 years, for most of which the HVVS has made a donation from the annual show. We will also be supporting an additional local charity as per previous years. If you or your associates would like to place an advertisement in the souvenir rally booklet, please contact us.</p>
                <p>All exhibits — including tractors, cars, lorries, motorbikes, and garden tractors — will be eligible to be judged <em>“the exhibit the judge would most like to own”</em>, and two prizes awarded. If you are able to exhibit this year, please visit our website at <a href="https://www.hvvs.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.hvvs.co.uk/</a> to complete an application form online. Please note that no entries will be permitted on the day. For further information, or if you wish to discuss any aspect of the show, please contact Henry on the above number or Mark on <a href="tel:+447974955617">07974 955617</a>.</p>
                <p>INSURANCE: All exhibits must be fully insured, and the owner must sign the section on the application to verify this. We look forward to seeing you on the 28<sup>th</sup> May and would like to thank everyone for their support in previous years. A total of £5,000 was raised in 2022 and this was donated to Lincs & Notts Air Ambulance.</p>
                <p>Regards,<br>Henry Goodwin”</p>
