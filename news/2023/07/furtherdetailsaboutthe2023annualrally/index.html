                <p>“Exhibits include: Victorian games room, kitchen, 1940s garden, a recreation of a 1940s street with a pub offering ale and cider, a sweet shop, school room, chapel, and cinema.</p>

                <p>There is a working water wheel, and the heavy oil engine shock is often run. The transport hall, mower shed, and the telephone museum are favourites. You can certainly fill a day there, and the attraction with the biggest reputation is the granary area room. Freshly baked cakes and scones, fresh sandwiches, and jacket potatoes, etc., are all at reasonable prices. Be warned though, the bread pudding sells out quickly! So snap it up early.”</p>
