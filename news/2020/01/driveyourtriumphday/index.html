            </h3>
            <p>Are you ready for <i>Drive Your Triumph Day</i>, Monday February 10<sup>th</sup>, to celebrate Sir John Black’s birthday, the man who organized Standard’s purchase of Triumph after the war and went on to make the cars we enjoy driving today? It’s just a couple of weeks away!</p>
            <p>This celebratory drive has been building momentum every year. Last year I received close to 350 photos from all over the world. This year is going to be a bit more of a challenge as February 10<sup>th</sup> falls on Monday. As tempting as it may be to plan a drive for the weekend, we’re going to keep true to the day, and please submit photos only taken on Monday, February 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020.</p>
            <p>The concept is straightforward. On February 10<sup>th</sup>, go for a drive in your Triumph. Take a scenic drive on a country road or out to lunch, to the market, to work, wherever. Go for a drive alone or in a big group with your local Triumph Club. Take your spouse, buddy, child, grandchild or your dog; then take a photo. The photo is mainly of the car, and the owner if possible, ideally in front a cool spot, landmark, scenic view, in front of the hardware store or in your driveway. If it’s the middle of the winter where you live and your car is in hibernation, or in the middle of a restoration, take a photo of it anyway in the garage. Some winter photos I’ve received have the garage door open with the car tucked under a cover, and snow outside. Have fun with it and participate.</p>
            <p>Next step is to email a high-resolution photo to <a href="mailto:driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com?subject=Drive%20Your%20Triumph%20Day">driveyourtriumphday@gmail.com</a>, along with some basic information: owner’s name, year and model of car, and place photo was taken (city, state, country). The photos will then be published not only in our club newsletter, but also in USA’s national magazine: Vintage Triumph Registry, and on the Drive Your Triumph Day website: <a href="https://driveyourtriumphday.shutterfly.com/">https://driveyourtriumphday.shutterfly.com/</a>.</p>
            <p>Be sure to contact me with any questions you may have and thank you in advance for getting the message out to your members and friends to <strong>drive their triumphs</strong> on February 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
            <p>Regards,</p>
