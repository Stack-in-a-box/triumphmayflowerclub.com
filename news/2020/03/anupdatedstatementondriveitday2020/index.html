            </h3>
            <p>The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs have issued an updated press statement, which supercedes the previous update from three days ago, on Drive It Day 2020 in relation to how it’s going to be affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“The FBHVC is committed to following the latest UK government advice on events and public gatherings pertinent to our member clubs and, as such, the following statement replaces all previous correspondence regarding National Drive It Day during this fast-moving situation.</p>
                <p>In response to the updated guidance and restrictions issued by UK government, the federation recommends that all activities that involve taking a historic vehicle out on the road specifically for the purposes of Drive It Day, now be abandoned. All enthusiasts are now urged to stay at home on 26<sup>th</sup> April 2020 and not partake in any non-essential travel for Drive It Day and instead, get involved in a nationwide social media campaign to spread positivity around historic vehicles during this difficult time.</p>
                <p>Currently, UK government are advising against all non-essential social contact. Our current general guidance to car clubs, that can be found on our website <a href=" https://www.fbhvc.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.fbhvc.co.uk/</a>, encourages the cancellation or postponement of meets, events and gatherings of people. Additional advice has now placed restrictions on non-essential travel of any kind.</p>
                <p>However, enthusiasts of historic vehicles are still encouraged to participate on 26<sup>th</sup> April 2020 in the mass sharing, via social media, of images and memories of themselves and their families out and about in their historic vehicles during a previous year’s Drive It Day. Use your chosen social media platform to share images and stories of memorable trips with your historic vehicles or indeed, what you might be working on within the ‘self-isolation’ of your garage or shed.</p>
                <p>The FBHVC are asking for all enthusiasts to share pictures using the hashtag <b>#DriveItDayMemories</b>.</p>
                <p>Post your picture onto the FBHVC social media feeds or those of your member clubs. We will be monitoring those social feeds and public posts published with the <b>#DriveItDayMemories</b> hashtag will be gathered onto a special area within the FBHVC website galleries in the future.</p>
                <p>As previously stated, with such a crowded event calendar, the possibility of achieving consensus for a revised Drive It Day date later in the year will be virtually impossible. Therefore, Drive It Day 2020 will not be re-scheduled for later this year, but will resume its normal format on 25<sup>th</sup> April 2021.</p>
                <p>For the latest advice for car clubs, events and other news, keep up to date via the federation news pages at <a href="https://www.fbhvc.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.fbhvc.co.uk/</a>.”</p>
