            <blockquote>
                <p>“The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs (FBHVC) is calling on the new Secretary of State for Transport — and the DVLA for which they will be responsible — to work with it to achieve, a “pragmatic and constructive” historic vehicle registration regime.</p>
                <p>The DVLA is responsible for vehicle registration and licensing on behalf of the Transport Secretary, having taken over the responsibility from local authorities from 1973.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>A Cabinet Office review of historic vehicle registrations has been undertaken under the previous government and has now been delivered to the new Secretary for Transport. The new government will obviously look at this in due course and any changes will be posted here. A submission was made by the FBHVC on behalf of historic clubs following a consultation with all clubs via a questionnaire. If you wish to find out more about the questionnaire results and the full FBHVC response please go to:</p>
