            <p>When time allows – great phrase that!</p>
            <p>The intention on these pages is to show that there are possibilities around the world to rescue and restore to their former glory many lonely and neglected Mayflowers. Over the years many such specimens have had the photos, and often details sent to Flower Power. For some this may not be a comfortable viewing experience, but if you’re a <em>glass half full</em> sort of person you can sleep easy in the hope that at least some of these cars have the prospect of a better future.</p>
