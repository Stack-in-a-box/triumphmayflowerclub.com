            <h1>Agenda of Upcoming AGM</h1>
            <p>This year we are holding our AGM at the Leicestershire Scout Headquarters in Leicester. All members are welcome to attend and to have a say and indeed it would be great if any one felt they could volunteer a little help to the running of the club. This is your opportunity to come along and say so. The committee, as is usual, will all offer their positions for re-election and any new nominations or offers to stand again for positions are taken on the day without too much formality. This year, we will also be making the AGM available for online attendees via a Google Meet video conference call. Details of how to connect to this can be found on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/news/2023/03/agmandvacantcommitteepositions">this news article</a>.</p>
