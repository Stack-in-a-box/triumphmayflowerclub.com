            <h1>Agenda of Upcoming AGM</h1>
            <p>This year we are holding our AGM at the Triumph Sports Six Club’s headquarters in Lubenham, Market Harborough. This is where our club now keeps all its spare parts. All members are welcome to attend and to have a say and indeed it would be great if any one felt they could volunteer a little help to the running of the club. This is your opportunity to come along and say so. The committee, as is usual, will all offer their positions for re-election and any new nominations or offers to stand again for positions are taken on the day without too much formality. The premises will be open from 10:45 AM for members who wish to purchase spares.</p>
